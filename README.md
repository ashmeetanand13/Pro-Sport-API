# Pro-Sport-API
An open source AMS system to help young professionals and sports teams, to level up their data injection and data processing


# Open Source Athlete Management System (AMS)

## About Us

We are a team of 4 passionate sports science professionals, and Nikhil (what title would you like), with over 10 years of combined experience working directly in the sports industry. Our passion for this project has brought us together, spanning half the globe (Ash based in LA, Tanuj based in NZ, Ivan in Switzerland, and Nikil in India). Our backgrounds span human performance measurement, sports technology development, and athlete support systems. Having worked hands-on with athletes, coaches, and sports organisations, we've experienced firsthand the challenges and gaps in current athlete management tools.

Our unique perspective comes from being practitioners first â€“ we understand the real-world needs of sports professionals because we've lived them.

## What We're Building

The Open Source Athlete Management System (AMS) is designed to be the comprehensive platform that teams and young professionals have been waiting for. Our system addresses the critical need for:

**Unified Device Integration**

- Seamless connectivity with performance monitoring devices
- Real-time data aggregation from multiple sensors and platforms
- Standardized data formats across different hardware ecosystems
- A no-code platform that will help you build team reports and solve your data storage problem on a budget. 

**Educational Foundation**

- Built-in learning modules for sports science principles
- Best practices for human performance measurement
- Practical tutorials for emerging professionals in the field
- Focus on being in the applied setting and leave the data to us. 

**Collaborative Workflow**

- Team-based athlete management tools
- Data sharing and analysis capabilities
- Communication platforms for multidisciplinary sports teams
- Help young professional in their research and build a strong foundation in sports science. 

**Performance Analytics**

- Advanced metrics visualisation
- Trend analysis and predictive insights
- Customizable reporting for different stakeholders
- Using ML to answer tough questions in sports about players' conditioning and rehab.

## Why Open Source?

We believe that advancing sports science and athlete care should be a collaborative effort. By making our system open source, we aim to:

- **Democratize Access**: Ensure that smaller teams and organisations can benefit from professional-grade tools
- **Foster Innovation**: Enable the global sports science community to contribute and improve the platform
- **Accelerate Learning**: Provide transparency in methodologies and algorithms for educational purposes
- **Build Community**: Connect sports professionals worldwide to share knowledge and best practices

## Our Vision for the Future

We envision a world where:

**Every Team Has Access** to sophisticated athlete management tools, regardless of budget or size. Professional-grade performance monitoring shouldn't be limited to elite organizations.

**Data Drives Decisions** across all levels of sport. From youth programs to professional teams, evidence-based approaches to athlete development become the standard.

**Technology Enhances, Not Replaces** human expertise. Our tools amplify the knowledge and intuition of coaches and sports scientists rather than replacing their critical thinking.

**Global Collaboration** accelerates innovation in sports science. Open source development creates a worldwide network of practitioners sharing insights and improvements.

**Young Professionals Thrive** with comprehensive tools and educational resources that help them build successful careers in sports science and athlete support.

## The Challenge We're Solving

Current athlete management systems often fall short because they're either:
- Too expensive for smaller organizations
- Too complex for emerging professionals to learn effectively
- Too fragmented, requiring multiple tools that don't integrate well
- Too closed, limiting customization and community input

Our AMS system addresses these pain points by providing a unified, accessible, and educational platform that grows with teams and individuals.

## Get Involved

Whether you're a sports scientist, developer, coach, or athlete, we welcome your contribution to building the future of athlete management technology. Together, we can create tools that truly serve the sports community's needs.
